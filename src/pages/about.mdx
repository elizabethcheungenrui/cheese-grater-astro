_The Cheese Grater_ is UCL’s student paper for campus news, investigations, and satire and the **Best Student Publication in London**  
([SPAs 2025](https://www.spajournalism.com/spa-2025-regional-award-winners/)).

We’ve been annoying people across campus since 2004, producing award-winning journalism, illuminating important issues at the university, and holding the establishment to account.

We print three times a year and whenever else we feel like it. During term time, we run a fortnightly newsletter,  
**[The Digestive](https://us17.campaign-archive.com/home/?u=65bd5c7a770205040fd2e9e8a&id=9679db51c3)**,  
packed with campus headlines, humour, and graphics.

Every Saturday at noon, we’re on Rare FM for our weekly radio segment, **[Grater Insight](/podcast)**.

As _The Cheese Grater Magazine Society_ at Students’ Union UCL, we also run:

- our feminist zine **_Women’s Wrongs_**
- our sketch group **the Graters**

_The Cheese Grater_ has twice been named  
**[Best Publication in London](/article/2025-01-16-the-cheese-grater-named-best-publication-in-london/)** —  
most recently in 2025.

We are proof that you can make it out of Ifor Evans Hall.

We are committed to public-interest journalism, student democracy, marginalised voices, and having a laugh.
